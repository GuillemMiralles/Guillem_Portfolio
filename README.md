ðŸ‘‹ Hello! My name is Guillem Miralles, and I am a passionate data scientist and AI enthusiast. ðŸ“šðŸ§ 

I have a degree in **Data Science** ðŸ“Š and a master's degree in **Artificial Intelligence** ðŸ¤– from the prestigious **University of Valencia.** ðŸŽ“

Welcome to my vibrant portfolio, where I showcase my diverse range of projects and their exciting results. ðŸ’¼âœ¨

Explore the intersection between data and creativity through my innovative data visualisations ðŸ“Š, predictive modelling ðŸ“ˆ and cutting-edge AI applications. ðŸŒŸ



# [Project 1 - FieldWizard: Predicting Positions and Formations for Success on the Soccer Field.](https://github.com/GuillemMiralles/Authomatic-Machine-Learning-Class) ðŸ”®ðŸ”¥


## Objectives
In this project, we sought to accomplish the following objectives using **Deep Learning techniques**:

1. **Predict possible player positions** on a soccer field based on their attributes.
2. **Predict the optimal team formation** for a team given the attributes of its players and the attributes of its opponents.

Throughout the course of this project, we utilized multiple dataframes and undertook a significant amount of data adaptation work. This included a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, which helped us gain insights into the data and inform our modeling process.

## Why this?
- The first project is interesting for its potential applications in player development, talent identification, strategic planning and injury management. It demonstrates the power of AI in sports analysis and decision making.  
- The second objective is intriguing for its potential to revolutionize strategic decision making in soccer. This model could help coaches design effective game plans, taking into account the strengths of their team and the specific challenges posed by opponents. It could also be valuable in dynamic situations, such as responding to player injuries or suspensions.

## Results

The results were impressive. Below is a summary of our findings:

| Task | Model | Accuracy | F1-Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Predicting Player Positions | Deep Learning Model | 0.97 | 0.99 |
| Predicting Player Positions | Linear Regression | 0.19 | 0.48 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Predicting Optimal Team Formation | Deep Learning Model | 0.783 | 0.782 |
| Predicting Optimal Team Formation | Linear Regression | 0.7 | 0.71 |
