# [Project 1 (Python) - Field Wizard: Predicting Positions and Formations for Success on the Soccer Field.](https://github.com/GuillemMiralles/Authomatic-Machine-Learning-Class) ⚽🧐🔥


## Objectives
In this project, we sought to accomplish the following objectives using **Deep Learning techniques**:

1. **Predict possible player positions** on a soccer field based on their attributes.
2. **Predict the optimal team formation** for a team given the attributes of its players and the attributes of its opponents.

Throughout the course of this project, we utilized multiple dataframes and undertook a significant amount of data adaptation work. This included a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, which helped us gain insights into the data and inform our modeling process.

## Why this?
- The first project is interesting for its potential applications in player development, talent identification, strategic planning and injury management. It demonstrates the power of AI in sports analysis and decision making.  
- The second objective is intriguing for its potential to revolutionize strategic decision making in soccer. This model could help coaches design effective game plans, taking into account the strengths of their team and the specific challenges posed by opponents. It could also be valuable in dynamic situations, such as responding to player injuries or suspensions.

## Results

The results were impressive. Below is a summary of our findings:

| Task | Accuracy | F1-Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Predicting Player Positions | 0.97 | 0.99 |
| Predicting Optimal Team Formation | 0.783 | 0.782 |

# [Project 4 (RStudio) - Deep in the Depths of Sleep: Creating Interpretable Models to Detect Sleep Phases Using Polysomnography Signals from Patients.](https://github.com/GuillemMiralles/Authomatic-Machine-Learning-Class) 🛌💤🔍

## Objectives
In this project, we try to **classify sleep stages** based on PSG signals using **Interpretable Machine Learning techniques**. Throughout the project, we employed interpretability-focused machine learning models to analyze PSG signals and accurately identify the different phases of REM sleep.

## Why this?
- This project was fascinating due to its potential impact on sleep research and healthcare. Accurate detection of REM sleep stages can aid in diagnosing sleep disorders, understanding brain activity during dreaming, and facilitating personalized treatment plans. The focus on interpretability ensured that the models' predictions were transparent and easily understandable by healthcare professionals.

## Results

The results obtained from this project were significant and demonstrated the efficacy of the interpretability-focused machine learning models. Here's a summary of our findings:

| Task | Accuracy | Interpretability Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REM Sleep Stage Detection | 0.92 | 0.88 |
